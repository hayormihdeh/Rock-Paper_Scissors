Rock-Paper-Scissors is a simple two-player game where, at a signal, players make figures with their hands, representing a rock, a piece of paper, or a pair of scissors. The winner is determined according to a set of rules. In this game, one player will be controlled by the computer and the other player controlled by you - the user (i.e CPU vs Player).
